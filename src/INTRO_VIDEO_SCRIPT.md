## Intro

Welcome to "dndinder", a dynamic web app enabling dnd players worldwide to find and match with other players, create game groups and more! We've designed the app using React with a firebase backend for authentication, cloud functions and no-sql database.

## Login page & authentication

Firstly as a new user to the site we can loing with our google account. All information on the site is only available to logged in users. Once logged in we've used local storage to allow users to remain logged in even after naviagating away from the page or closing the browser.

## Characters list

Once logged in we can view characters of other players on the site. We'll come back this later.

## Edit profile

We're going to update our user profile to to say a bit about us and set our playing preferences.

## Add character

Next we create our own playing character. We'll set our class, race, a bit of background info and add our avatar.

## Create group

We now want to create a game group. We'll be dungeon master for this one.

## Group page
