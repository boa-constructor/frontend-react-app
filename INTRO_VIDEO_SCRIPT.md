## Intro

Welcome to "dndinder", a dynamic web app enabling dnd players worldwide to find and match with other players, create game groups and more! We've designed the app using React with a firebase backend for authentication, cloud functions and no-sql database.

## Login page & authentication

Firstly as a new user to the site we can loing with our google account. All information on the site is only available to logged in users. Once logged in we've used local storage to allow users to remain logged in even after naviagating away from the page or closing the browser. We also require users to be logged in before being allowed to access any other page on our site.

## Characters list
Once logged in you are greeted with a list of all avaible characters on the site, more on this section later.


## Edit profile

We're going to update our user profile to to say a bit about us and set our playing preferences. This way other users can quickly and easily know how people want to play!

## Add character

Next we create our own playing character. We'll set our class, race, a bit of background info and add our avatar. We aim to expand this out in the future to allow userd to build much more modular and fleshed out characters, including prepared spells, items, weapons and more!

## Create group
Now we have made our user profile and our character we are going to want to find people to play with! Let's be the Dugenon Master for this game.


## Group page
Here on the group page we can see information about our group, our group portrait and party memebers. We aim to expand this in the furute with things like "dates avaiable to play", "game notes" and campigns completed. 

## Characters List

Now we have our profile and group set up we can start adding new party members! On this screen you are presented with a very brief outline of characters, clicking individual cards tells you more!

## View Single Character

This card will tell the user much more about the hero they want to join their party, clicking here will invite them to our group we created before!

## Group page
